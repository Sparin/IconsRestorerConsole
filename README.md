# IconsRestorerConsole
Fork of [IconsRestorer](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/639486/Save-and-restore-icon-positions-on-desktop) by Ivan Yakimov

implementation in the console version without GUI

## How to use
* %nameofprogram% -save *For save icons position on the desktop*
* %nameofprogram% -restore *For restore icons position on the desktop*

For example I renamed executable file from output to *ir.exe* and put it in %systemroot%/System32 folder. Everytimes after using RDP I'll call *ir -restore* from command line

Also you can make alias through DOSKEY
